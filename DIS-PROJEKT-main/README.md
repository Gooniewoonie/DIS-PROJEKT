You would first need to set up your database and run the SQL files (drop,schema,ins) in the following order. One notable thing is that the insertion SQL file works by copying the contents of the given files(track, mood, ablum.. csv), and inserting them into the database into their respective tables, however you will need to specify the path yourself, every CSV file which contatins the data is under the webapp folder. 

Next specify in the __init__ file your database specs, dbname, user, password, host and port. At last run the run1.py file.
